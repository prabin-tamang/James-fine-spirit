# James-fine-spirit
This is a project that I did in my masters program which I revisited and improved again. This website is a simple concept website for a small business which specalises in craft beer and spirits. This project demonstrates some of the issues involved with the development of small websites including: the design process, colour and typography, site structure and navigation, standards compliant and semantic coding.
